**Introducing VIMz Private Proofs: Zero-Knowledge Image Authentication for the Modern Web**

I'm excited to share VIMz Private Proofs, a cutting-edge web application that solves a critical challenge in our digital age: proving image authenticity without compromising privacy.

**🎯 The Problem:**
In an era of deepfakes and misinformation, how do you prove an image is authentic without revealing sensitive originals? Journalists need to protect sources. Researchers need to safeguard unpublished data. Content creators need to maintain creative control.

**🔬 The Solution:**
VIMz implements folding-based zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) - the same cryptographic technology securing blockchain transactions - for image verification. Based on peer-reviewed research from PETS 2025.

**💡 Key Innovations:**
• 25% faster proof generation than existing solutions
• 90% smaller proof files (<11KB vs 120KB+)
• Sub-second verification time
• WebAssembly + GPU acceleration for 10x performance boost
• Privacy-preserving: original images never need to be shared

**🌐 Real-World Applications:**
✅ Photojournalism: Prove editorial integrity without exposing sources
✅ Scientific Research: Maintain data integrity while protecting IP
✅ Legal Evidence: Verifiable chain of custody
✅ Social Media: Combat misinformation with cryptographic proof

**🚀 Try it Now:**
The web app is live and open-source. No installation needed - it runs entirely in your browser with client-side cryptography.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/PiotrStyla/Private-Proofs-of-Image-Manipulation-using-Folding-based-zkSNARKs

**Tech Stack:**
Flutter Web, Dart, Nova Folding Protocol, BN254 Elliptic Curves, WebAssembly, GPU Compute Shaders

This project represents the intersection of cutting-edge cryptography, performance optimization, and practical privacy engineering. I believe tools like this are essential for building trust in our increasingly digital world.

Would love to hear your thoughts on zero-knowledge applications in digital media!
