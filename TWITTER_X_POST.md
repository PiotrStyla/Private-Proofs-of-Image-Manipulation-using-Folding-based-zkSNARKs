## 🧵 OPTION 2: Thread (Better Reach)

**Tweet 1/7 (Hook):**
🔐 I built SealZero - a web app that lets you prove image authenticity without revealing the original.

Zero-knowledge cryptography meets image verification.

Thread 🧵👇

---

**Tweet 2/7 (Problem):**
The problem: How do journalists prove photos are real without exposing sources? How do researchers show data integrity without compromising IP?

You need cryptographic proof, not blind trust.

---

**Tweet 3/7 (Solution):**
SealZero uses zkSNARKs (same crypto securing blockchains) for image authentication.

Prove you applied edits (crop, resize, color adjust) without sharing the original image.

Mathematical certainty. Complete privacy.

---

**Tweet 4/7 (How It Works):**
How it works:
1. Upload original + edited images
2. Select transformations applied
3. Get proof (~3 min, <11KB file)
4. Share proof + edited image
5. Anyone verifies in <1 second

All in your browser. No servers. No uploads. 🔒

---

**Tweet 5/7 (Performance):**
Performance vs competitors:
⚡ 25% faster proof generation
📦 90% smaller files (11KB vs 120KB)
✅ Sub-second verification
🚀 WebAssembly + GPU accelerated

Built with Flutter, Dart, Nova Folding Protocol.

---

**Tweet 6/7 (Use Cases):**
Perfect for:
📰 Journalists (protect sources)
🔬 Researchers (safeguard IP)
⚖️ Legal evidence (chain of custody)
🎨 Creators (combat deepfakes)

GDPR-compliant by design. Client-side only.

## 🎯 OPTION 3: Viral Hook Thread

**Tweet 1/6:**
90% of people can't tell real images from AI-generated fakes.

But what if you could PROVE authenticity mathematically?

I spent 3 months building the solution. 🧵👇

---

**Tweet 2/6:**
Meet SealZero.

It uses zero-knowledge cryptography to prove your images are real - without revealing the original.

Think: Prove you edited a photo without showing the unedited version.

**Tweet 3/6:**
Why this matters:

Journalists can't expose sources.
Researchers can't leak unpublished data.
Creators can't share raw files.

But they ALL need to prove authenticity.

SealZero solves this impossible problem.

## 💡 OPTION 4: Story-Driven Thread

**Tweet 1/5:**
3 months ago I read a paper about using zkSNARKs for image verification.

Yesterday I launched it as a live web app.

This is the story of building SealZero. 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/5:**
The challenge: Build a cryptographic proof system that runs in a browser.

Most zkSNARK implementations are server-side. I needed client-side everything.

Solution: Flutter + WebAssembly + GPU compute shaders.

10x performance boost. ⚡

---

**Tweet 3/5:**
Hardest part: Optimizing proof size.

First attempt: 120KB proofs (too big for mobile).
After LZMA2 compression + circuit optimization: 10.8KB.

That's 90% smaller. Works on any device. 📱

---

**Tweet 4/5:**
Coolest feature: Zero-knowledge.

You prove transformations (crop, rotate, color adjust) without revealing the original image.

Journalists can protect sources. Researchers can safeguard IP. Creators can combat deepfakes.

All with mathematical certainty.

- **Single tweet**: Quick engagement, less commitment
- **Thread**: Better reach, X algorithm favors threads

### Hashtags:
- Use 2-3 max (X algorithm penalizes hashtag spam)
- Mix popular + niche:
  - Popular: #OpenSource #Privacy #WebDev
  - Niche: #zkSNARKs #Cryptography

### Engagement Tactics:
1. **First Hour Critical**: Reply to every comment/retweet
2. **Ask Questions**: End with "What would you use this for?"
3. **Quote Retweet**: Share your own thread with new context next day
